# Methods
A list of different bracket filling methods.

### Calibrations
  * Adjust travel advantage (Higher points possible, non-square root)
  * Adjust weight on preseason expectations (7:1, 3:1, 1:1)


## Accuracy
Accuracy methods don't care about anything other than trying to be as accurate as possible.

#### Max EV
Work backwards, pick best team to fill in each slot.


## Value
Value methods try to maximize competitive performance by take opponent picks into consideration.

#### Overall Value
Bracket as a whole is more likely to happen than it is to be picked by another player.  Product(Team Finishes) / Product(Team Picked to Finish) > 1.

#### Round-by-Round Value
Each round is more likely to happen than it is to be picked by another player.


## Seed Quotas
Seed quota methods try to match the amount of upsets that we expect to see in a tournament.  These are the least accurate, but most fun.

### Dimensions
  * Seed Sum vs. Quota
  * Historical vs. This Year
  * Forward vs. Backward

  Remember, when moving backward, use conditional probabilities.
